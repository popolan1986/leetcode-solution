Definition
---------------
A backtracking algorithm tries to construct a solution to a computational problem incrementally, one small piece at a time.
Whenever the algorithm needs to decide between multiple alternatives to the next component of the solution, it recursively
evaluates every alternative and then choose the best one or meet the restrictions.
